# Human-Activity-Detection-LSTM-Divide-and-Conquer-
The project is aimed to build a predictor model that predicts human activities such as Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying ( 6 class classification) using the Smartphone data.

* The complete dataset for this project was obtained from the below site
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones

* The file Human Activity Recognition Prediction.ipynb contains Exploratory Data Analysis, T-SNE for visiualizing the data and I have fit the data with the classical Machine Learning models such as Logistic Regression,Linear SVC,RBF SVM Classifier,Decision Trees, Random Forest Dts ,GradientBoosting Dts and also Deep Learning model (LSTM). 

* The Image files are the T-SNE Visualizations of the data points with 6 classes.
